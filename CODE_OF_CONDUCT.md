## Code of Conduct

This project has adopted the [Contributor Code of Conduct 3.0](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/3/0/code_of_conduct/)

Please report your concerns, even if they fall below the threshold of a CoC issue to conduct@collaboraoffice.com promptly.

As regards Addressing & Repairing Harm the repair will be proportionate to the violation and connection to the project. There should always be a way back through apology, reconciliation and improvement. Here are some example repairs:

* If an offensive spammer appears in our matrix channel, they can expect to be immediately banned without further thought or due process.

* If an extensive contributor repeatedly violates our shared values, then if they ignore counsel & advice to try to remediate their tone and behavior, they can expect some exponentially escalating ban from the project.

We expect more examples over time to help highlight our approach.
